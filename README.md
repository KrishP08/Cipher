Hi My name is Krish Patel
# Cipher Collection Website

Welcome to the **Cipher Collection**, a web-based tool to explore five classical encryption techniques. This project demonstrates the implementation of these algorithms using **JavaScript** and **HTML**. You can interact with each cipher through a simple and intuitive interface.

### Live Demo
Visit the website at [krishp08.github.io/Cipher/](https://krishp08.github.io/Cipher/).

## Ciphers Included:
1. **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic substitution cipher using linear algebra.
2. **One-Time Pad (OTP)**: An unbreakable cipher when used with a truly random key as long as the message.
3. **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.
4. **Railfence Cipher**: A transposition cipher using a zig-zag pattern to encrypt text.
5. **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.

### How It Works:
- **JavaScript**: Handles all encryption and decryption logic.
- **HTML & CSS**: Provides a clean, user-friendly interface for interacting with the ciphers.

### Technologies Used:

### Project Structure:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the website.
- **styles.css**: Custom styles for the visual layout.
- **script.js**: JavaScript logic for the cipher operations.

### Installation and Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishp08/Cipher.git
